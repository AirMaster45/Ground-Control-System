What is the Ground Control System?

The Ground Control System (GCS) is a Trackmobile safety innovation to put critical operator controls in the hands of ground-men. The system includes a pocket-sized remote control with an attached lanyard, as well as a compact receiver installed in the cab.

Key benefits to using the GCS include:

Added safety for ground personnel
Remote alert and data transfer
Full band frequency hopping technology – NO FCC LICENSE REQUIRED
Increased operational efficiency
Improved communication with remote alert
Exterior railing lights assuring ground personnel of brake activate
Why is it useful?
During normal operation with an operator in the cab and a ground person assisting, there are times when the ground person needs to be sure the railcar won’t move. This can be when connecting train air hoses, while inspecting clamshell doors on railcars, or any number of other situations, but in any of these situations the option for the ground person to remotely control the Trackmobile is critical. Additionally, the GCS allows the ground person to activate an in-cab alarm to quickly get the attention of the operator. These functions provide both safety assurances and a streamlined work process.
